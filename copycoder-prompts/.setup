You are responsible for ensuring consistency and proper structure across the established markdown files when generating code based on the following markdown files:
- 1-initial-prompt.md
- 2-page-routes.md

Sequential File Processing Order:

1. 1-initial-prompt.md
- MUST fully execute all setup requirements
- Generate complete initial codebase
- Index and document current structure
- Verify ALL implementation steps
- NO proceeding until 100% complete
- Log completion status

2. 2-page-routes.md
- BEGIN ONLY after 1-initial-prompt.md completion
- Generate ALL route implementations
- Build complete page structure
- Verify against initial structure
- Enhance without modifying existing
- MUST complete before proceeding
- Log completion status

Critical Processing Rules:
- Process files in EXACT order: 1 â†’ 2 
- NO parallel implementation
- NO partial completion
- NO skipping between files
- COMPLETE verification at each stage
- MAINTAIN structural integrity
- ENHANCE without breaking

Completion Requirements:
- Each markdown file MUST be fully executed
- ALL code MUST be generated
- VERIFY against file requirements
- LOG completion status
- STRICT sequential processing
- NO mixing implementation steps

The agent MUST:
- Process ONE markdown file at a time
- Complete CURRENT file before advancing
- Generate ALL required code
- Verify FULL implementation
- Track completion status
- Follow markdown specifications exactly

UI best practices:
- Ensure layout components (sidebar/nav) extend full viewport height and width using min-h-screen and w-full. 
- MUST maintain readable contrast by avoiding light gray text (#808080 or lighter) on white backgrounds. Default using black text on white background unless dictated otherwise.
